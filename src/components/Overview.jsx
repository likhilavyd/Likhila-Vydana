        I focus on front-end development with a strong emphasis on clean, responsive, and 
        user-centric design. I enjoy transforming creative concepts into polished digital 
        experiences, using tools like HTML and Bootstrap to build interfaces that are both
        functional and visually refined. With a balance of technical precision and design sensitivity, 
        I aim to craft web solutions that are intuitive, modern, and thoughtfully executed.
