        Hi, I'm Likhila Vydana — a student and passionate web developer with a strong interest in 
        clean UI and interactive design. I focus on building responsive, user-friendly websites that 
        combine functionality with visual appeal. My journey began with a curiosity about how websites 
        work behind the scenes, and it has grown into a meaningful path in front-end development. 
        As I continue to learn and explore new technologies, I’m excited to turn creative ideas into impactful digital experiences.
