                    Hi, I'm Likhila Vydana
                    </p>
                    <p className="content">
                    A student and passionate web developer with a strong interest in 
                    clean UI and interactive design. I focus on building responsive, user-friendly websites that 
                    combine functionality with visual appeal. My journey began with a curiosity about how websites 
                    work behind the scenes, and it has grown into a meaningful path in front-end development. 
                    As I continue to learn and explore new technologies, Iâ€™m excited to turn creative ideas into impactful digital experiences.
